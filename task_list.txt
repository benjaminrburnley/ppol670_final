## Task List 
Redistricting Data Hub: 
https://redistrictingdatahub.org/state/florida/

1. Download Files and clean for analysis  
  District Maps
  - 2022 Congressional District Map (DONE) 
  - 2012 Congressional District Map (DONE)
  
  District Level
  - Elections Results 2022  
  - Elections Results 2018
  
  Precinct Level 
  - Election Results 2022
  - Election Results 2018
  
  Bonus: 
  - Any additional voting data
  - Any and all variables aggregated at the district/precinct level (i.e. Census Demographics, etc.)
  
2. Map Congressional districts and identify overlaps 
 - Might be able to use the package overlapptest
 - Aaron says there are tools to do this in sf
 
3. Calculate turnout changes 
 - Midterm 2018 vs. Midterm 2022 total turnout  
 - Percent for each party 2018 vs. 2022
 - R/D ratio for each precinct 
 
4. Visualize these metrics 
 - Show that precincts that have been redistricted are/are not different than precincts that are not redistricted
 - Other visualizations (open to ideas!)
 
5. Model changes (optional)
  - Using district/precinct level data, can we model how redistricting impacts turnout? 
  - DV: Turnout/Percent Republican/Ratio R to D
  - MAIN IV: Give every precinct that is redrawn a 1 and every precinct that is not a 0 
  - CONTROLS: Any/all variables at observation level (demographics, past election results, presidential election dummy)
